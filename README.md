When I finished with project I will upload the Finished code to main branch (and maybe somethimes I will keep up-to-date so you don't need to look which is the last day I worked with the project)

At the moment I'm focused for the FreeCodeCamp projects. I'll go trough their courses because my knowledge is very incomplete. But it's anoying because I always want to try something new and that try can take 2-3 hours when i recognise that I get out of the way to earn the FCC certificate. 
I uploaded and connected all my projects. On my main Portfolio site you can check my FreeCodeCamp project at the section > Projects, and there you'll find all my current FCC's finished project.

-Today I made a good progress with szekelytur.weblog.rs (in the future szekelytur.com) website. I need pictures about the hostel and pansion to finish the site. I belive I need only few more hours to finish everything.

-I bought my first ever domain acidias.co.uk trought the aws and somehow I connected this main repositori to the aws, so every git i update here is visible on the domain ^^
it was so easy or I'm soo good for this.

-It's already 9-12 and I'm not feeling very good but I should finish the "about" section on my portfolio site.
