Making my portfolio site
# How to search here:
For now, Every day I finished with the work I Will create a new brach and give name the current date.
Here in the main branch I will update the README file what I did that day.
When I finished with project I will upload the Finished code to main branch (and maybe somethimes I will keep up-to-date so you don't need to look which is the last day I worked with the project)

P.S Sorry for my Perfect English, it could be worse... :P
